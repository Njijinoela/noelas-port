        <h2 id="about">WHO ARE WE?</h2>
        <p>Ajani Centre for Rights and Care is a duly registered Community based Organization based in Kajiado, Kenya. This
            organization was conceived out of our passion to alleviate the pain and suffering of survivors of sexual and
            gender
            based violence.
        </p>
        <p>Our vision is to raise empowered individuals through provision of holistic support to survivors of sexual and
            gender
            based violence and other vulnerable members of the society.
        </p>
        <p>We acknowledge that significant strides have been made towards formulation of policy with regard to sexual and
            gender
            based violence. However, there remains a big gap in the enforcement and in the after care of these survivors.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fulfilling our vision, we have several missions and projects tailored around 2 main objectives:
            <br>
            i. Providing legal support.
            <br>
            ii. Providing psychosocial support
        </p>

            <h2>LEGAL SUPPORT SERVICES</h2>
            <P>
                Ajani Centre for rights and care provides legal advice and representation for survivors of sexual and gender
                based
                violence on pro bono basis. This includes follow up with investigative agencies such as the police and court
                attendances.
            </P>
            <p>
                We also run sensitization campaigns to create awareness on the rights of survivors and all the vulnerable in
                society. We
                conduct legal research and advocate for policy changes with regard to sexual and gender based violence.
                Further, we carry out trainings for stakeholders such as community leaders, paralegals, administrators of
                rescue
                centers, police officers and members of the public.
            </P>

            <h2>PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT SERVICES</h2>
            <P>We have a robust counseling department with several active trained counselors who provide survivors with the
                much needed
                support that they need to get through the emotional trauma that comes with sexual and gender based violence.
            </P>
            <p>The department offers both individual and group counseling sessions for the survivors. They also provide
                psycho-education, mentorship and peer counseling.</p>
            <p>Holistic psycho-social support and organizing and offering training sessions for our staff is also within the
                departmentsâ€™ scope of work.</p>
            <p>The department further conducts the necessary research and providence of materials in order to give wholesome
                service to
                our survivors and contribute to the growth of the centre.</p>
